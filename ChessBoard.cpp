    *          - Pieces on the UPPER half of the board are set to have color "WHITE"

    *          - All pawns on the BOTTOM half are flagged to be moving up.
    *          - All pawns on the BOTTOM half are flagged to be NOT moving up.
    *          - All other parameters are default initialized (this includes moving_up for non-Pawns!)
    *   
    *      - Pawns (P), Rooks(R), Bishops(B), Kings(K), Queens(Q), and Knights(N) are placed in the following format (ie. the standard setup for chess):
    *          
    *          7 | R N B K Q B N R
